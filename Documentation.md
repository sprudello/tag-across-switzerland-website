|      | 0.0.1   | ‚úçÔ∏è Every time you work on the project, add a new line here and describe in *one* sentence what you have achieved. |
|      | ...     |                                                                                                                   |

## 1 Inform

### 1.1 Your Project

This is the infrastructure to play a huge game of tag like the people on "[Jet Lag: The Game](https://www.youtube.com/@jetlagthegame)" did, in this you can pull challenges, manage your coins, penalty time and transportations.  [Youtube link to an episode of the game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2tJqO6nCSc)

‚úçÔ∏è Explain in more detail in 50 to 100 words what exactly you want to achieve in this project, and what you hope to learn from it.

### 1.2 User Stories

| US-‚Ññ | Commitment | Type | Description                               |
| ---- | ---------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1    |            |      | As a ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I want to ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, so that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è |
| ...  |            |      |                                           |

‚úçÔ∏è Each user story has an integer number (1, 2, 3 etc.), a commitment (Must or Can?), and a type (Functional, Quality, Boundary). The user story itself has the following form: *As a ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I want to ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, so that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è*.

### 1.3 Test Cases



| TC-‚Ññ | Initial State | Input | Expected Output |
| ---- | ------------- | ----- | --------------- |
| 1.1  |               |       |                 |
| ...  |               |       |                 |

‚úçÔ∏è The number has the format `N.m`, where `N` is the number of the user story that the test case covers, and `m` is counted up from `1`. Example: The third test case covering the second user story would have the number `2.3`.

### 1.4 Diagrams

‚úçÔ∏è Insert a use case diagram with at least 3 use cases here; and a sketch of what your website should look like.

## 2 Plan

| AP-‚Ññ | Deadline | Responsible | Description | Planned Time |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1.A  |          |             |             |              |
| ...  |          |             |             |              |

Total:

‚úçÔ∏è The number has the format `N.m`, where `N` is the number of the user story to which the work package relates, and `m` is alphabetized from `A` upwards. Example: The third work package related to the second user story would have the number `2.C`.

‚úçÔ∏è A work package should take about 45 minutes for one person. The total number of work packages should be approximately: `Number of R-Sessions` √ó `Number of Group Members` √ó `4`. If you are working in a group of three on a project with two planned R-Sessions, you should have `2` √ó `3` √ó `4` = `24` work packages. If you find that you do not have enough work packages here, think of additional "Can" user stories for Chapter 1.2.

## 3 Decide

‚úçÔ∏è Document your decisions and assumptions here regarding your user stories and the implementation.

## 4 Realize

| AP-‚Ññ | Date | Responsible | Planned Time | Actual Time |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 1.A  |      |             |              |             |
| ...  |      |             |              |             |

‚úçÔ∏è Every time you complete a work package, record here how long you actually spent on it.

## 

## 5 Control

| TC-‚Ññ | Date | Result | Tester |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| 1.1  |      |        |        |
| ...  |      |        |        |

‚úçÔ∏è Don't forget to add a conclusion that puts the test result into context.

## 6 Evaluate
